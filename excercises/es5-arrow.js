"use strict";

//Use this process:
//0. Move the function inline as a parameter instead of passing it
//1. delete function keyword, add arrow after the argument list
//2. remove the name, make the function anonymous
//3. if function is one line then curly braces ({}) are not needed and the return keyword is implicit (automatic/assumed)
//to rewrite all examples below to use arrow functions
// Note: on the 4th example you will need to write it from scratch
